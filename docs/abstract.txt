The sensorimotor system is constantly tasked with deciding which errors to learn from and which to ignore. Recent work has shown that humans are able to accurately parse internal versus external sources of motor errors as small as 2 deg: Participants demonstrate robust adaptation to the error component caused by a visuomotor rotation but no adaptation to size-matched errors that are due to intrinsic motor noise (Ranjan and Smith 2018, 2022, Kim et al, in prep). In this talk, I'll discuss a novel Bayesian decision-making model that I've developed to explain how the motor system may discriminate and learn from such small errors. The Parsing of Internal and External Causes of Error (PIECE) model frames implicit adaptation as a process of causal inference regarding the source of error, with the magnitude of motor corrections reflecting state estimation and the observer's belief that their movement was externally perturbed. In this manner, the PIECE model takes inspiration from, but also contrasts with, previous causal inference models (Wei & Kording 2009, Gaffin-Cahn et al 2019) and more recent computational models that frame the goal of adaptation as one of re-aligning the perceived hand position with the movement goal (Tsay et al 2022, Zhang et al 2024). Taken together, our behavioral and modeling results provide a normative explanation of how sensory and predictive cues are combined by the nervous system to discount intrinsic motor noise and adapt to small perturbations in order to keep movements finely calibrated.
